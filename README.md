# NetworkingProject
Repo for networking project

This project was done as part of my Networking class' coursework.

The project is written in Python, and uses Python's socket libraries.

The purpose of the project is to write two programs, one that acts as a server and one that acts as a client. The client and the server must communicate with each other, as well as be able to transfer files using UDP.

Another prerequisite of the project is that there must be applications of both Selective Repeat Protocol and Alternating Bit Protocol in place to prevent packet loss.

I have more in-depth within the respective update folders.
